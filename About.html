		<b>Innovative.</b></p>
		
			<p class="mar">There is a technology that is widely used with great success in medicine, telecommunications, astronomy, security, biology, etc. but which is ignored in finance, it is spectrography. Commonly called cycle analysis or spectral analysis, it is with this technology that we have developed a brand new innovative mathematical model in technical and quantitative analysis.<br><br>
			On this site, we present not only indicators like you have never seen but also a new vision, a new approach, and this to master financial and economic variations like never before.<br><br>
			</p>
		
		<b>Unique.</b></p>
		
			<p class="mar"> To our knowledge, no other software offers the features that we are going to present to you. Except for a so-called 'momentum' curve, all other indicators are curves generated according to our proprietary mathematical model. As a result, via this site, you have a new financial perspective that stands out from other traditional tools, a significant advantage.<br><br>
			Another very important feature that our research has revealed is the presence of Phase Shift in the cycle of financial variations. No other analysis software seems to consider this aspect that occurs frequently. There is a whole opportunity for profit to be made here because Phase Shifts, both upward and downward, generally produce a substantial movement that is very profitable.<br><br>
			</p>

		<b>Effective.</b></p>
		
			<p class="mar"> Cycles have a characteristic that is worth its weight in gold!<br><br>
			They are repetitive and therefore we can generally easily predict when and in how much time a cycle will begin a change of direction.
			In our TUTORIAL, we present some stocks that have this particularity of being cyclical like clockwork for years. By identifying such stocks via spectral analysis, we then have a head start on the market and we satisfy the first rule in the stock market, which is to have good timing! <br><br>
			The second rule that we want to satisfy is that of mastering the art of always knowing the true trend of financial variation. This is why we generally present two analysis charts for the same stock, one in the short term (daily, 2Days/Bar) and another in the medium or long term (weekly, monthly). This avoids false short-term trends, and the use of the short-term chart also serves as fine-tuning; it also allows you to better grasp sporadic opportunities.<br><br>
